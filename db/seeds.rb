  ingredients: ["300‚ÄØg Arborio rice", "1‚ÄØL vegetable stock", "250‚ÄØg fresh mushrooms (e.g., cremini or button), sliced", "100‚ÄØg grated Parmesan cheese", "100‚ÄØmL dry white wine", "1 medium onion, finely chopped (approx. 120‚ÄØg)", "2 cloves garlic, minced", "2 tbsp olive oil (approx. 30‚ÄØmL)", "30‚ÄØg unsalted butter", "Salt and black pepper to taste", "2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped (approx. 8‚ÄØg)"],
  portion_size: 4,
  instructions: ["Begin by finely chopping the onion and mincing the garlic. Clean and slice the mushrooms evenly. Warm the vegetable stock in a separate saucepan and keep it at a gentle simmer‚Äîthis is key to maintaining the cooking temperature of the risotto. Measure out your rice, wine, cheese, and herbs so everything is ready to go.", "In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 3‚Äì4 minutes until soft and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another minute, stirring frequently to prevent burning. Toss in the sliced mushrooms and saut√© for 6‚Äì8 minutes until they release their moisture and become golden brown. Season lightly with salt and pepper.", "Add the Arborio rice to the pan and stir to coat with the oil and mushroom mixture. Let it toast for 1‚Äì2 minutes, then pour in the white wine. Stir continuously until the wine is mostly absorbed. Begin adding the hot vegetable stock, one ladleful at a time, stirring frequently. Wait for each addition to absorb before adding the next. This process takes about 18‚Äì20 minutes.", "Once the rice is creamy and al dente, remove the pan from heat. Stir in the butter and grated Parmesan cheese until melted and well combined. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and black pepper. Let the risotto rest for a minute, then sprinkle with chopped parsley before serving. Serve immediately while hot and creamy. Enjoy as a hearty vegetarian main or as a luxurious side dish."],
